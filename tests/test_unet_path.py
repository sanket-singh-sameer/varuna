"""The U-Net inference path, exercised end to end.

These tests do not check that the model is *good*. They check that the path
through it works: a checkpoint on disk is found, its architecture and dB
normalisation are read back from the file rather than guessed, tiled inference
stitches without seams, and the result flows into the same polygon and
attribution code the baseline uses.

That distinction matters. Training quality is measured on Kaggle against the
dB baseline and reported in `oil_unet_best.report.json`. What can go wrong
*here* is plumbing: a checkpoint that loads into the wrong architecture, a
normalisation that drifts between training and inference, a stitching bug that
leaves tile edges in the mask. So the checkpoint used below is deliberately
untrained and its predictions are deliberately not asserted on.

Skipped when torch and segmentation_models_pytorch are absent, which is the
normal state of the demo laptop.
